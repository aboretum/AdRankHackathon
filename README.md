# AdRankHackathon
Hackathon project for adknowledge use case.

Our project uses Youtube Data api to retrieve youtube videos, meta data by a user provided keyword. The retrieved video is allowed to be sorted by view counts, upload date and categories. The website statistics are also tracked and stored in the backend, such as the keyword ever searched, the time each user has visited the website.
